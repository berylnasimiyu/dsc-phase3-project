# Tanzanian Water Wells: Predictive Maintenance for Tanzanian Water WellsÂ¶
## Project Overview
In Tanzania, ensuring widespread access to clean water remains a significant challenge. The country's existing water wells, vital for providing this essential resource, often face issues ranging from disrepair to complete failure. To address this pressing concern, our project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance model that classifies water wells as either functional or in need of attention.

### Stakeholders:
Our primary stakeholders include NGOs dedicated to water access initiatives and the Government of Tanzania. These entities can benefit significantly from a predictive model that informs them about the status of existing water wells, guiding strategic decision-making and ensuring the sustainability of clean water supply.

### Problem Statement:
The scarcity of clean water in Tanzania demands a proactive approach to manage and maintain water wells efficiently. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and the Government of Tanzania are confronted with the task of identifying wells that require urgent repair or replacement. Our predictive maintenance model aims to be the solution by predicting the condition of water wells, thereby optimizing resource allocation for maintenance and construction efforts.

### Objective:
The overarching goal of this project is to develop a binary classification model capable of predicting whether a water well is functional or in need of attention. By achieving this, we aim to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to allocate resources effectively, prioritizing maintenance efforts where they are most urgently required.

### Dataset Description: Pump it Up - Water Pump Functionality Prediction
#### Overview:
This dataset, sourced from the "Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table" competition on Kaggle, focuses on predicting the functionality of water pumps in Tanzania. The dataset comprises three CSV files: train.csv, train-labels.csv, and test.csv.

#### Files:
train.csv: Contains information about the training set, including features related to water pumps in Tanzania.
train-labels.csv: Provides labels corresponding to the training set, indicating the functionality status of each water pump.
test.csv: Represents the test set for which predictions need to be made.
##### Features:
The features in the dataset include, but may not be limited to:

id: Unique identifier for each water pump.
amount_tsh: Total static head (amount of water available to waterpoint).
funder: Organization or individual that funded the well.
installer: Organization or person that installed the well.
longitude, latitude: Geographic coordinates of the well.
basin: Geographic water basin.
region: Geographic location.
population: Population around the well.
#### Target Variable:
status_group: The functionality status of the water pump (target variable). Categories may include "functional," "non-functional," or "functional needs repair."
#### Use Case:
This dataset is particularly relevant for NGOs and government agencies involved in water resource management. The predictive model aims to optimize resource allocation for well maintenance and construction, ensuring sustainable access to clean water.

#### Ethical Considerations:
Given the nature of the project, ethical considerations should be emphasized. Transparent and responsible use of the model is crucial to avoid potential negative impacts on communities.

This dataset offers a rich source of information for developing a predictive maintenance model for water wells, aligning with the broader objective of enhancing water access in Tanzania.
